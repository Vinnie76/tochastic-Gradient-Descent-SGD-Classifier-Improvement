# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-SGD-Classifier-Improvement
The repository is an improvement of the accuracy of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier by adding shifted images to the training set. 
## Description
1. **Load Data**

Load the MNIST dataset from sklearn 

2. **Data Preparation**

Split the dataset into 2 parts: training set for training the model and test set for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. 

3. **Expand Training Data**

Use the functions from the previous group work to increase the size of the training set by adding new digits with values that have been shifted to the left, right, up or down by 1 pixel. 

Note: This process should result in your training set being 5 times more than it was previously. 

4. **Modelling** 

Train your model on the training set and use cross validation to evaluate the model's training performance. 

Plot a confusion matrix to visualise the model's prediction performance for each of the digit classes in the dataset 

Test the accuracy of your model on unseen data and evaluate its performance by cross validating the model.
